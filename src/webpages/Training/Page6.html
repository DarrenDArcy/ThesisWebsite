        <h2 class="text-left"> 1.  Information Gathering</h2>
       <p class="text-justify"> The likelihood of success for most attacks depends on this
        phase so it is only natural to invest the majority of time and at
        tention here. Information gathering techniques are elaborated in the Framework .
        Some of the information gathered is used to determine the attack vector, possible passwords, i
        dentify likely responses from various individuals, refine goals, become familiar and comfortable with
           the target, and formulate strong pretext(s).</p>

        <h2 class="text-left"> 2. Establish Relationship and Rapport</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"> This phase establishes a working relationship
            with the target. This is a critical point as the quality of the relationship
            built by the attacker determines the level of cooperation and extent to which
            the target will go to help the attacker accomplish the goal. It can be as brief as
            hurrying towards the door with a big smile and eye contact so the target holds the
            door open for the attacker to walk through. It could be connecting on a personal level
            over the phone or as personal as showing family pictures and sharing stories with the
            receptionist in the lobby. It can also be as extensive as building an online relationship
            with the target through a fake profile on a dating or social networking site. Creating rapport
            is covered more in depth in the Framework..</p>

        <h2 class="text-left"> 3.  Exploitation</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"> This is when the attacker uses both information and relationships to
            actively infiltrate the target. In this phase, the attacker is focused on maintaining the momentum
            of compliance that was built in phase 2 without raising suspicion. Exploitation can take place through the
            divulging of seemingly unimportant information or access granted/transferred to the attacker. Examples of
            successful exploitation include:

        <ol start="1">
        <li> The act of holding the door open or otherwise allowing the attacker inside the facilities</li>
        <li>Disclosing password and username over the phone</li>
        <li> Offering social proof by introducing the SE to other company personnel</li>
        <li> Inserting a USB flash drive with a malicious payload to a company computer</li>
        <li>Opening an infected email attachment</li>
        <li>Exposing trade secrets in a discussion with a supposed “peer”</li></ol></p>


        <h2 class="text-left">4.  Execution</h2>
        <p class="text-justify"> This phase is when the ultimate goal of the attack is
            accomplished, or for various reasons, the attack is ended in such a way as to not
            raise suspicion regarding what has occurred. Generally, it is not good practice to end an
            attack with the target questioning what just happened. Instead, it is better to leave the
            target feeling as if they did something good for someone else that allows possible future
            interactions to continue. This is also where any loose ends are addressed such as erasing digital
            footprints and ensuring no items or information are left behind for the target to either determine
            that an attack has taken place or the identity of the attacker. A well planned and smooth exit strategy
            is the attacker’s goal and final act in the attack.</p>
